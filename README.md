# :exclamation: Rule
You must commit to main.

# :memo: Current To-Dos
Feel free to leave ideas here
- [ ] Create better website so it links together a bunch of our projects here
      - I'm thinking like Ascii and tracker can be on the same site, so like create a homepage that can link to the indivual projects
- [ ] Tracker to update and list number of daily commits per person
  - [X] Got it deployed on github pages
  - [ ] Integrate into larger webpage  
- [ ] Finish Image to Ascii thing :) check out [this](https://github.com/NolanChai/Commit-Challenge-2024/blob/main/ascii.html)
